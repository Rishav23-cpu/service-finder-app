# ServiceFinder - Building Bengaluru's Service Revolution
Day 1/90 Live Build | Rishav kr shahu | 20 | Bengaluru Hustler
🎯 The Problem I See Every Day
1.3 Crore Bengaluru people face this weekly:
text
9 AM: "AC not working, 40°C outside"
→ Call 5 mechanics → 3 don't pickup
→ 2 say "2 days" → Family sweating
→ Finally guy comes → charges 2x quote
→ Never answers next time

Same story: JEE tutors ghosting, plumbers no-show, maids disappearing.
Market math: ₹6,500 Crore trapped in unreliable WhatsApp forwards.
 # 💡 My Fix - ServiceFinder
30 seconds from "AC broke" → "Fixed tomorrow 4 PM":
Verified workers only (ID proof + background check)
Live calendar (see empty slots instantly)
Fixed prices upfront (no "extra charges" drama)
WhatsApp chat (haggle done, book direct)
Post-job rating (bad workers auto-filtered out)
📈 Why This Works (Real Numbers)
text
Bengaluru households: 30 Lakh
Weekly service need: 10% = 3 Lakh calls
Conversion rate: 30% = 90K bookings/week
₹200 avg ticket = ₹1.8 Crore WEEKLY market
My goal: 1% = ₹18 Lakh/month revenue

Competition gaps I'm exploiting:
Urban Company: ₹800 AC service (I target ₹400)
JustDial: 60% fake listings (I verify 100%)
WhatsApp: No calendar (I show real-time slots)
# 🛠 My Build Plan (Learning Live)
text
Phase 1 (Now): HTML/CSS/JS landing page
Phase 2: React dashboard + Firebase users
